## Description

This educational botnet is designed specifically for researchers and educational institutions. Its main purpose is to provide students with an understanding of botnets including their source code and operational complexities. The ultimate goal is to encourage research that can lead to innovative approaches, in better understanding and effectively dealing with botnets. <br />
##### Every block is explained in the code itself

#### Technologies

- Python

## What is a Botnet

A botnet is a network of Internet-connected user computers (bots) that have been infected with malicious software (malware), allowing the computers to be remotely controlled by an operator known as “bot herder” or “bot master” via a Command-and-Control (C&C) server to perform automated tasks such as stealing information or launching attacks on other computers (Kaspersky, 2023). The malware used to infect these computers is usually delivered through spam emails, malicious links, or by exploiting software vulnerabilities. Botnet malware has been used to give controllers access over a large number of machines at the same time. This allows botnet operators to leverage compute and bandwidth resources from several networks for harmful purposes.

## How To Use

In the server script add your own local IP address in line #20

In the client script add your own local IP address in line #6

Run the "server" program first, then the "client" program on your virtual machine.

Once the connection is established you can type **list** command to view the list of hosts connected to your server or type **select** followed by the host index number from the list.

After you select a host, you type and send any command that hosts machine.
